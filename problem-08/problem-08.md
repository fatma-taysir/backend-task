# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

## Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. since we are iterating through the array once and performing constant time operations (adding to a set and checking membership) for each element.


## Space Complexity
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Since we are using set to store the unique elements.
