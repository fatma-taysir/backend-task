1. Fill container B with 3 litres
2. Pour the 3 litres from container B into container A

2. Pour water from contaier A into Container B till it's full [ A = 2 , B = 3 ]     
3. Empty contaier B [ A = 2 , B = 0]
4. Pour the 2 liters from A to B [ A = 0 , B = 2]
5. Fill container A again [ A = 5 , B = 2]
6. Pour water from contaoner A to contaier B, as it already has 2 liters you can only pour 1 liter and remaining 4 liters in contaier A [ A = 4 , B = 3]
